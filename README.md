# Vibmory_HapticPatternGenerator

Welcome to **Vibmory_HapticPatternGenerator**. This is a simple tool created to help users, regardless of their level of experience, to manage and visualize multiple speakers as haptic actuators and generate a pattern to test. Developed with QT and C++, it aims to provide a clear and concise interface for those who are interested in learning about or working with haptic technologies.

## Purpose

This software is an attempt to offer a means for understanding and interacting with haptic cells, allowing users to modify amplitude and frequency settings for individual actuators during specific time that makes a vibration pattern. Its application is versatile, suited for anyone curious about exploring haptics, whether for learning, experimentation, or research.

## Key Features

1. **Manage Multiple Acuators:** Simultaneously control several haptic actuators, each represented as a separate cell.
2. **Visualize in Real-Time:** See the status and changes of each cell in real-time.
3. **Customize Animations:** put different frames together and play them to make a haptic animation.
4. **Synchronize Actuators:** Manage all actuators cohesively for a unified haptic experience.

## Published Work

This tool has been developed and utilized in a research study, and the findings have been documented in a paper titled "[Vibmory - Mapping Episodic Memories to Vibrotactile Patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3569009.3572747)". This paper does not endorse but rather employs the software as a means to conduct experiments. For those interested in the practical applications and potentials of this software, this paper could serve as a useful resource.
